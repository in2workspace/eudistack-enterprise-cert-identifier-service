## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **EUD-220 — SBOM CycloneDX and License Gate**: Added CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM generation (`npm run sbom`), CI license compliance gate (`license-gate.yml`), and automated SBOM asset attachment to GitHub Releases. The evaluator is vendored at `.github/scripts/license-gate.mjs` with its own `node --test` suite, which the gate workflow runs before evaluating anything: this repository verifies itself without depending on any other one. Free-text upstream license names resolve through a reviewed SPDX equivalence table instead of piling up as expiring exceptions, and the `CODEOWNERS` rules that protect the policy, the exception register and the evaluator sit at the END of the file, because GitHub applies the last matching pattern.
